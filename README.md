# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This notebook was created as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** course: *Tools For DataScience*.

## 🔍 Summary

In this module, I worked on a final project to demonstrate some of the skills I learned in the course.  
As part of the project:
- I used **Markdown cells** to create headings,ordered lists,unordered lists and tables.  
- I used **Code cells** to practice and demonstrate the interface and functionality of **Jupyter Notebook**.
